                        I took an extensive web development course back in 2021 that provided a deep dive into HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript. 
                        Through this course I aquired knowledge for the basics of web development. I learned how to implement user authentication and manage sessions and cookies 
                        to maintain user states securely, using JW tokens and bcrypt.
                        The curriculum covered critical security practices,teaching me the basics on preventing SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
                        In addition to front-end and back-end development, the course emphasized understanding the HTTP protocol, including request methods and status codes. 
                        I used Postman extensively to test and monitor APIs, gaining experience in sending requests and analyzing responses. 
                        I built full-stack applications using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, incorporating EJS as a view engine to render dynamic HTML pages.
                        The course also introduced me to tools like NPM for package management and the command line for efficient development workflows. 
                        At the end of this course, I built my own proof-of-concept web application: the YelpCamp Project. This website allows users to create an account, log in, 
                        upload images, and add information about campgrounds. Users can also search for and review other people's campgrounds. The project was designed to be s
                        traightforward for a first-time developer but ensured the implementation of every key concept taught throughout the course.
