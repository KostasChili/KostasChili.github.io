            <p>The purpose of this page is to serve as a simple yet robust portfolio. <br>
                Here, you can find a detailed CV, including links to projects I have worked on.<br>
                You will also find descriptions of both personal and work projects. <br>
                For the latter, I ask for your understanding, as I will only share what is appropriate 
                while maintaining professionalism. Please note that the content of this page is updated constantly and might change with time.
